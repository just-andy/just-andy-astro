## In A Nutshell

[William Hill](https://www.williamhill.com "William Hill website") is a household name - not just in the UK, but across the betting world. They've transitioned to the world of online gambling very successfully, with horse-racing accounting for **around £1.4billion of turnover in 2017 alone** (and it's very much part of their history).

But in today's highly competitive - and lucrative - world of online betting, William Hill can take for nothing for granted. So when their then Director of Sportsbook (i.e. Head of Betting) challenged the online product team to deliver the **'best horse racing experience on the market'**, he meant it.

It called for smart user-centred design. It called for a presence to combat the promiscuity of punters with an average of two or three accounts across different bookmakers.

And it called for a willingness to knuckle down to get the job and that's what I did…

## Research and Personas

The first page that we had to tackle was the meetings page. We set out to
improve two KPI's:

- Net Promoter Score through an improved navigation
- Increase in turnover via regions outside UK and USA

Starting with web analytics we identified the top user goals of the page and
again gathered insights into gaps in the page functionality.

The product team wanted to make sure the new page could support the ability to
continually provide the appropriate racing over the 23 hour period in a number
of countries. This led us to consider a rolling electronic program guide (EPG)
of data.
