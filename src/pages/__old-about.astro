          <h2>The Backstory </h2>
          <p className="text-bold">
            After completing an Honours Degree in Consumer Product Design, I
            started freelancing in Web Design and paid my dues to a few
            agencies.Remember IE6 bug&apos;s and designing with tables... yes I
            did that.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was fortunate enough to land a role based in Gibraltar with &nbsp;

              title="William Hill website"
            >
              William Hill
            </a>
            , one of the UK&apos;s largest bookmakers. During my eight years, I
            worked my way up to the &nbsp;
            <b>Sportsbook UX Lead</b>.&nbsp;My time in the Med allowed me to
            make significant strides in my career. Building teams, managing in
            remote and in -house teams all the while championing UX with
            changing leadership.
          </p>

          <p>
            After a long time away, it was time to return home with my wife and
            son into the growing tech scene in Scotland.
          </p>

          
          <h3>First Design System</h3>
          <p>
            Returning to Edinburgh I was fortunate enough to be focus on
            building out the design system for &nbsp;
            <a

              Wood Mackenzie
            </a>
            , one of the world&apos;s leading energy consultancies. My daily
            responsibilities moved between building out our design system site
            in Gatsby, documenting components in React &amp; MDX and
            transitioning our system from Sketch to Figma.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our design system teams successfully delivered and governed the
            Hydrocarbon design system that was used by all of the feature teams.
          </p>
          <h3>Second Design System</h3>

            I took on the challenge of migrating their brand guidelines and
            multiple products into a multi-brand and cross platform design
            system.
          </p>
          <p>
            It&apos;s early days on this project but we have already released
            v1.0 of our Figma component library and documentation. In the new
            year we will be working towards creating the coded component library
            with our development team.
          </p>
          <h3>Side Projects</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout my career, I&apos;ve always loved the technical side of
            digital design. I continue to build out small sites and side
            projects to keep my skills on point; you are more likely to find me
            in Codepen than Dribbble. Over the past two years I have been
            fortunate enough to provide my design skills to the fitness platform
            &nbsp;

            . I was one of their users for two years prior, so getting to work
            on a project I use daily is a true passion project.
